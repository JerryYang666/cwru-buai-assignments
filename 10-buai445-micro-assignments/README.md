# Micro Assignments

## M2

Read the CustomerLimited SPSS dataset into Python and then use it for everything below. The overall goal is to understand the customer better:

A. Find the summary descriptive statistics for the four Personal Tendency (scale) variables using describe. Attach the output and interpret what we learn from these about the customer base.

B. Find the frequencies, mode and median for the three demographic variables. Attach the output and interpret what we learn from these about the customer base.

C. Create a bar-chart and a scatter-plot for any set of suitable variables. Interpret the two charts.

D. Find a suitable crosstab that helps us understand the sample or consumer base better. Interpret.

Include all the Python codes, output and interpretations in one Word document in your assignment tab (for Micro assignment 2). Remember, you can insert screenshots if you want but put everything in one word document.
