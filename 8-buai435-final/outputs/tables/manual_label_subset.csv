3946,R2N7I2KR88OY92,5,"Best tuner I've had in years I tried two different Snark tuners, and they were not very accurate.  I gave them away.  This little tuner has worked very well for me for the past year; it's small and can stay on the neck of my mandolin and can tune either by vibration or sound, and is quite accurate.  Very good tuner IMO."

4694,R378R6T3HCSRKO,5,"Great quality, quite small and unobtrusive Using on a desk for web meetings. Great quality, quite small and unobtrusive. Captures nearby audio very clearly, minimal echo/ambient noise. Not good for a large room unless you have multiple (and an audio mixer or the ability to use multiple sources with your software)."

5117,R1JHO708DYSY3S,1,"Waste of money and time, do NOT buy! I am returning this viola. All you get would be all kinds of problems. Not playable at all, don't waste your money and time!"
3544,RU6CMJBVX3SUT,1,"you will get cheap cable I'm not sure if my Fender branded cable is same as this one but mine, which cost about the same, died a couple days ago after about 6 month of intermittent use ... when I cut the cable where it flexed the most to see I was shocked to find there was exactly 5 strands of copper inside. 5 strands of thin copper ... I know copper is expensive these days but when you pay $10+ for a cable you expect a little more. For a legendary brand like Fender I certainly expect more than some no name cheap brand. I will not look at Fender the same way ever again ..."
1775,R3216P24L5NH5Q,5,The best This is the best delay pedal in the market. Period.
1330,R1FQ4JM1P4ZQH5,5,Five Stars Nice item for the price
828,R30XGQLR3FZVHS,5,"Excellent product, great value A nifty device, perfect suitable for condenser microphones with around 4.0-4.5cm diameter. Looks great, padded spring loaded clip to hold microphone firmly."
3204,R39HFTB2S5DJW8,4,"Fun, but not for recording. The DD9M is a great machine.  It's internal speaker is a bit quiet, but  once hooked up to an external amp or headphones it sounds nice.  The  drumpads are a bit small, but you'll manage.  It is easy to use, but of  course it is no replacement for an acual set of drums.  Some of the  instruments, such as a cowbell, horn, etc. are fun and sound great.  It's  extremely good at making fun rythyms and for beginners to learn how to keep  a beat.  I would not suggest it for recording studio levels, but for any  home use/personal recording its great.  It also doubles as a metronome  which can be useful."
14,R144Z7G4R8UHLV,5,Simply bad ass guitar mine was cheaper due to wear and tear but this guitar is sickkk Only complant was wrong item pictured but correct model and the knobs and tuning keys were a little corroded but is easily fixed and sounds great and looks brand new love the guitar thanks! Amazing sound simply a versatile and bad ass string through body solid piece guitar high quality fretboard and emg pickups. Perfect for metal blues jazz punk hell anythi ng
4947,RVT0I0O3KFBHF,5,Exactly what I was looking for Great tuner. Looks awesome in my rack and tunes my bass guitar perfect. The tuner is really sensitive which is good. I was able to hook it up  through my effects loop and still use the mute function on the front. The ins/oust are on the back of the tuner and amp and I can still plug my bass into my amp input. Looks professional.
4559,R1PB4GU51JS3K4,5,"Well made, good fit, nicely padded It's a soft case so you wouldn't want to put a $150 Ukulele in it and travel the country, but it's very nicely made for a soft case.  Worth spending a couple of dollars more for."
5192,R1E0UQ19UZNP8L,4,Not my favorite but...not too bad. These are different. Kind of hard on the finger tips but will assist in building up the callouses...<br />The sound is different that Martin's and Aquila's which may be a little more mellow....but the price is great. I would recommend you to give a set a try! They break in much faster than Aquila's which take what seems forever to stay in tune and are different with the one wound string...can't really figure out the reason for that though...<br />Pro's<br />Inexpensive<br />Con's<br />Tough on the fingers....but will build them up...
4004,R2AWZPL75K8L4P,3,I would recommend I've used it for about a month and a half now. I noticed the the letters on the cover are starting to wear off. It really doesn't bother me considering it was only like $2 I think. I think I'll be able to make long term use of it but it wouldn't surprise me if I eventually needed to buy a new one cause I wont be able to read the letters anymore. Oh and the letters are kinda off compared to the lit up keys underneath the cover but that's not a big deal to me. Idk some people are picky

5494,R1Q513R2FW4CBK,4,"Great travel guitar, some work required.. This is a good little guitar, especially for what it is, very portable.<br />It has a nice neck and fretboard, but the hardware is a little on the cheap side.<br />The pickup is high output and it's great for rock, but a little rough for the clean stuff.<br />Right out of the box it was horribly set up. I spent 20 - 30 minutes adjusting the bridge down and adjusting the truss rod.<br />When I was done, now it plays great.<br />The one thing I changed was the pickup, I swapped it for a Seymour Duncan Invader. That gave it a little more 'oomph', but the stock one is adequate, I'm just a metalhead. Overall, it's a good travel guitar as well as just a decent guitar, but be prepared to do a full setup. The bag is good and it should travel as well as the Ministar it's replacing."

4522,R3BC7M9UR8CFIO,5,"my roommates and neighbors already hate me and my band mates are jealous already I was skeptical about getting a low watt amp, but this baby can rock any place; my roommates and neighbors already hate me and my band mates are jealous already. Why you should buy it?<br /><br />The sound is amazingly clean.<br />The price is unbeatable.<br />Feels rich and smooth.<br />Great to play the blues and some AC/DC.<br /><br />This is a wise first step in the world of tube amps; would recommend it regardless."
8408,R314NFLCIKEU06,4,Works well as a karaoke mic I purchased this as a second mic for a karaoke machine at home.  It sounds better than the mic that came with the karaoke machine- so much so that I'm thinking of getting another one of these to replace the original that came with the machine.  It is nice that it comes with an adapter just in case we might wish to use it with some other equipment at some point.

5572,R1KJH6SGRERVS8,5,"My new favorite I have tried many brands and types of shoulder rest for violin over the years and have found the Kun brand the most comfortable and secure. When the Kun standard came out, it became my favorite.  Then, the Kun Bravo came along and took my heart.  It functioned about the same as the standard, but the wood model was just too cool. When the carbon fiber Voce came out, I was a bit put off by the price, but decided to give it a try.  I am glad I did. It is light, secure on the instrument, fits my shoulder wonderfully, and as a result I hold the violin securely with little fatigue. My teacher tried it and he has converted to the Voce. I predict it's use will spread through the orchestra the way Evah Pirazzi strings did. I own several violins and really appreciate the ease in which the Voce adjusts to different widths of instrument.  Summary: I love it."
7426,R3AN7IGB3DT1CQ,5,"Since receiving this mute, I have had no noise complaints from my neighbors. This straight aluminum mute results in a metallic, sometimes nasal sound, and when played at loud volumes can result in a very piercing note. My trumpet creates a high end measurement of 100 dB one meter from the bell. This practice mute cuts the loudness to 50db, but shows uneven harmonic structure and is not a mute that is meant to be enjoyed for listeningâ€™s sake.  I consider this mute more just for practicing with to reduce the volume emitted."
1027,R1YEWEOZN84CBF,5,This is a nice product works very nicely and at a decent price. It comes with a nice holding case to keep it in good condition. Good quality sound.

7065,R30BLTDYO3DI49,4,"Strong and inexpensive This is a great inexpensive bench, capable of easily holding my 190lbs.  The padded foam top is supportive and after a month of daily practice use, shows no signs of sagging or taking on an impression.  Adjustments are simple, but not quick, so if you have different people who need to use this, it's a workable but not perfect solution.  Hence, only 4 stars instead of 5."
6561,RSK4OSI8ABTBR,5,"... for over a month now and it is a great instrument. The sound is very bright (not subtle ... I have owned this ukulele for over a month now and it is a great instrument.  The sound is very bright (not subtle and sweet like my wooden ukulele), but it is very pleasant sounding for being made entirely of plastic.  I got it so I could leave it in the car during all times of the year, and so I could take it camping or out in the canoe (this guy can get wet!). As a plus, it is a little harder to play.  There is more tension on the fret-board, so I am building more strength while playing.  It is very affordable and attractive to look at!"
5991,R1EB7GYYLIWCIX,5,"Cordon Classical Guitar The tone and playability of this beautifully made classical guitar far exceeded expectations. Beautiful fit, finish and hardware make tis guitar a true bargain. Perfect for young beginner guitarists."
6734,R1C7PMAVICNX8S,4,Ocarina Pendant My sister loves Taichi. Bought this along with the song book to learn how to play this pendant. Necklace is adjustable. Cute to wear with a casual outfit.
1195,R39G67GV2SXHCX,5,I'm happy with my purchase It is exactly what I was looking for and I'm satisfied with the product. It has a great tone and is so very light that is weighs nearly nothing.
3245,R3JIA7RQCW5LCL,4,"Seems pretty good! Like the 1 star reviewer says Just opened it and gave it a blast.  Seems pretty good!  Like the 1 star reviewer says, it is 2 pieces of wood joined down the center - and - the color of the wood is not consistent, mine is much lighter at the mouth end and more like the coloring in the picture at the other end - but - the wood quality and varnish job is not bad.  It does not give a deep resonant sound, it's more of a mid tone, but that's the trade off for the compact size.  Plays really well without wax, circular breathing, vocal noises and all.  Perhaps a touch expensive for what you get, but overall, a decent little travel didge.  I like it.    One unexpected bonus of the short length is that you can cover the end with your hand while playing.  Useful for  muting the sound and for making additional effects."
3937,R33COPGESCUMTW,3,"Yes it holds the pencil, but it doesn't stay on the stand! This little spring does what it is required to do: hold my pencil. This is good, because without it,  i continually knock the pencil off the stand onto the floor. However, when i first tried to use the spring, both the pencil AND the spring ended up on the floor. The clip simply is not strong enough to crasp the ledge of the stand. Quick fix: add a piece of tape and all is well."

It has a lot of versatility for creating many different tones, and has all the features I was looking for. The overall tone is pretty clean which is what I prefer. It gets pretty loud, I keep it between 1 and 2 when practicing alone, and only at 5 when playing with my band. Needless to say it is great for small gigs and practice, though it is pretty big.<br />I play a Fender Standard Jazz bass, and play some country, and rock music."
5170,R22UC7IHGAZ8D,1,"Decptive Seller - Stay Away For Own Sanity I have received the Barcelona Student 1/2 size violin I purchased from Austin Bazaar. I have tried to contact Austin Bazaar on the phone twice and left 2 messages. They didn't contact me back. I emailed Austin Bazaar and they replied with 3 links of their policy OF 30 DAY RETURN IF THE ITEM IS DEFECTIVE AND SETUP INSTRUCTIONS. I followed the 3 links they sent me to setup the violin AGAIN and had no sound. I tuned the strings with the Korg Chromatic Tuner TM-40 I bought from Amazon and matched the tunes of G, D, A & E. But, it doesn't have any sound when I pulled the bows. It came with 2 bows and both don't work. Austin Bazaar ignored my voice messages and emails by refusing to call me back and reply back with the Return Authorization Number. BUYERS, BEWARE OF THIS SHADY SELLER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2067,R1TS8R5W8NEDWX,5,Five Stars Good deal.
4081,R23F4I2EPXCIXU,5,"Big sound Love the amp. Big sound but very portable. Thought about getting the bigger version, but unless you do a lot of performing at larger venues, this machine is great."
3541,R1R9M53C9VTK0E,5,"Ernie Ball's are my total  strings of choice I have a Takamine TB240SC acoustic bass which i have tried many many strings on. Including some expensive ones but i never could get it to resonate or project they way i thought it should. This included, painstaking break-in and setup.<br /> I had just about given up and was ready to sell it when i was ordering strings for my other guitars (which all are equipped with various Ernie Ball's) and saw the Earthwood's.<br /> I thought &#34;what the heck&#34; they were inexpensive and always fast shipping through Amazon so i ordered them.<br /> Let me tell you!!!! this guitar came alive!! the resonance was there along with the projection, no more muddy sound... bright ,clean, clear beautiful sound coming from the mahogany big body...just as it should have been all along..Thank you Ernie Ball and thank you Amazon..."
7172,RBRIXITKFYALC,5,Well made and Easy to Carry Bought this for my daughter who rides her bike to school and slings her violin over her shoulder. It's very well made and lightweight.  We got the blue color and its really nice.  I highly recommend this case.
866,R36KJT1W9IE01N,4,"Best tuner out there!!!!! Great tuner! It tunes accurately and has an option to tune through vibrations allowing me to tune in noisy rooms. The reason I reccomend it to so many ppl is because of its accuracy and ease in tuning. The lines are color coded based on how close to the right pitch you are. It clips on comfortably and stays on well. The head can be tilted in any direction and this surely outshines any tuner I've tried (quite a few). I gave it four stars because of its quality. Unfortunately, these tuners don't last too long. They usually crack or come apart after a decent fall. Two of mine still functioned but couldn't be clipped on after they fell. I ordered a few because they are really good and I always want to have one at hand:)"
6307,R1V86EC2Q91ZBR,3,"2 out of 3 ain't bad. I picked up 3 of these. One oh them came with a cross threaded bolt, disappointing at first, but I was able to rethread it. Other then that everything was as expected. Oh, and mine don't smell bad."
3346,R37KAQYUHRYWDY,1,These are useless. Do not bother I bought two of these units and the output was barely audible in the ear buds.. These are useless. Do not bother.
2847,R2TAZ3VPAA6HFR,5,"Excellent Light come with Lightening Service Excellent Light for reading at night. I have been using this LED for more than 6 month and it work great. Recently couple of LED stop working and eventually for some reason it didn't work , when i contacted Seller and ask about the &#34; LIFETIME WARRANTY&#34; they send me another brand new LED lamp and it is working awesome. I would recommend this to friends and great service by the Seller."
7225,R1K5HH6Q9DEMVS,5,"Great strings to emphasize bass on a bright guitar I got these strings for my Seagull 25th anniversary mahogany/spruce. Most light strings are too bright and do not drive the top well enough; these strings added volume and bass, keeping the nice trebles and adding some nice Martin-like bass boom to the lower strings. I'll be using these from now on!"
1597,R2RTVX5H1AK3LP,4,Great deal &#34;Got these for my daughter. The product shipped very fast. For the money it is a great deal. I plan on making another order.
2287,RZ8R8SG1UVSCL,5,"Cables shouldn't be expensive. Cables shouldn't be expensive.  I thought the connectors looked a little suspect, but they work fine.  Good sound quality, but I'm using Shure SM58's.  I'm getting good sound and volume."

733,RLO9M8QXD2KZQ,5,"YOU NEED THIS PEDAL BASS PLAYER STAPLE FOR EVERY PEDAL BOARD...<br /><br />You have to understand the envelope filter effect before you can FULLY appreciate everything this pedal and Source Audio can do. The amount of control this pedal gives you over the many different filter sounds that are provided is rediculous and helps you customize your own sound. Now this is truely a modeler pedal (meaning it is programmed to sound like the best envelope filters available on the market, plus it's own customized sounds) so it helps to be able to alter certain sounds to give your tone a unique twist. It has a large foot print on your board but it is completely worth it. Standard chain order tells us bass players to put an envelope filter closer to your original signal, but put it before any effect you would like to alter (I.e. distortion, fuzz, synths). This is NOT just for dubstep sounds...it is one of the most useful and multifunctioning pedals one can own. 6 save able presets give you a huge arsenal of customized sounds<br /><br />Here are my own uses: Envelope Filter, Auto Wah, Standard Wah via Expression Pedal, Phaser, Sequencer via LFO, Wobbels via HotHands3, Swells via Volume Pedal, EQ (stand alone) and Boost.<br /><br />Source Audio has struck gold..not only with the effect but with the control this pedal gives the user...I have played many different venues and every time I utilize this beauty many questions are asked about how I get the sounds from my bass. I have a decent pedal board setup but the SABEFPro is by far my most treasured pedal. I rock a Spector Legend it has passive pickups with an active preamp and I have never had any issues with ANY bass (Active, Passive, Piezo) I've ever plugged into it. Spend the money, you WILL never look back and you will find yourself challenged to play different styles and your bass playing will change with this tool.<br /><br />ONLY CON: It can be a little confusing a first (option knobs, back page menu, LFO), you have so many selections and abilities to change a sound that you have to understand the filter effect and Q settings and many other things before you jump into this baby. Read and study the manual then research the envelope filter effect before you try to change sounds otherwise you will literally destroy your own sound. DONT WORRY, once you pick it up it becomes second nature and you'll find yourself changing difficult effects on the fly.<br /><br />I have become a Source Audio Follower, what these pedal have done to my sounds has blown away every venue I play from smaller intimate venues to large theaters in the Philipines.<br /><br />KEEP MAKING THEM SOURCE AUDIO, ILL WILL ALWAYS BUY THEM!!!"

I did buy the extra Yamaha mouth piece as the reviews had suggested. So far so good! It came with clarinet reeds instead of saxophone reeds, so the extra 10 are useless to me. Good thing I bought extra of those too. Total purchase= less than a whole year renting from the school= happy momma!"
1615,R1TIMAHLZZYMSV,4,"Great repair for old guitar. I have an old Harmony acoustic I have been trying to refurnish over the last year.  I wasn't looking to spend too much time or cash on it (it has been used and abused), but it still produces a beautiful tone.  I was however having a problem with my 1st and 3rd strings staying tuned.  My guitar still had the original tuning machines oon it, and they were very worn.    That being said, these were a perfect fit for what I needed.  They seem to be of decent quality, and have been holding tuning well, even under stress of a capo.  The bushings that came with them are cheap, so I used the bushings that were already in the headstock and that worked out just fine.    If you are looking to get your old guitar playable again, these seem to be the way to go.  Definitly not the most beautiful set, or the MOST sturdy, but they do the job."
6821,RAJZ99EEQBU4M,5,Great! Great quality for the price. Very impressed. Includes everything a beginner needs. Got it as a Christmas present for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it.
8604,R1XSEXQFF2V70G,5,"Exactly What I was Looking for in a Classical Guitar I did not purchase this product from Amazon, but seeing as there was no feedback yet on this model, I wanted to add my two-cents worth.<br /><br />Aesthetically:  This is a beautiful guitar.  The attention to detail is meticulous.  The finish is clean and even, with no evidence of buildup in the sharp corners such as where the neck meets the body.  The grain of the wood shows beautifully. The white spruce on top has a clean, bright, fresh look to it. The mahogany on the back in sides has a \\""deep\\"" 3-dimensional grain with some light figuring, and an attractive red-amber hue. The 6-layer binding on the top is an especially tasteful touch, and is colored in with a subtle, understated scheme (I particularly like this one strip in the center that is colored to match the mahogany B/S, sandwiched between two white strips that match the hue of the top).  The rosette is an intricate, but not overwhelming mother of pearl and ebony inlay.  Overall, a pleasure to look at.<br /><br />Body/Neck Construction:  As mentioned before, the finish is even across the body.  This is a spruce-top model, with a fairly wide-grain to the spruce toward the edges.  Otherwise, the grain is straight and even.  Back and sides are of African Mahogany, which a Cordoba rep informs me comes from Gabon, and is not the \\""sapele\\"" mahogany (which is, in fact, an attractive and effective tonewood).  All woods used are solid, no laminate construction used in this model.  The neck is also a nicely figured african mahogany, and has an ebony fingerboard with just the slightest hints of a ligher grain through, so I don't think this was dyed.  The neck is not as thick as the traditional classical neck, which will make it an easier crossover instrument to those familiar with acoustic or electric guitars.  Nut width is about 52mm, which is standard for a classical guitar, though about 9mm wider than the typical acoustic guitar.  This guitar also follows the trend of introducing a truss rod to the classical guitar neck, which had been considered heretical until recently.  I consider this a welcome change, having had classical guitars with bowed necks, and the only option to repair them would have been very expensive (pull the fingerboard, plane the neck, add new fingerboard and frets. $$$).<br /><br />Tuners are gold-colored plating with ebony-colored knobs. The tuners operate smoothly, and tuning is very precise.<br /><br />Now for the meat and potatoes:  How does it sound?  Very nice, thank you.  This guitar has a RICH low end that is not overpowering.  Very well balanced across the entire range.  The treble end is very sweet, clear and singing, but not overly bright.  You can pull a sufficiently sharp \\""edge\\"" from the trebles if you hit it right, but is not as crisp as some other instruments I've played.  I personally like it, but some prefer a more brittle high end, which is not what this guitar delivers with the supplied Savarez Cristol HT strings.  I am looking forward to trying it out with some carbon fiber trebles in the near future.  Overall, I would describe the tone as warm and sweet, without becoming \\""mushy\\"".  Individual notes are well defined.  Again, as you work your way up the neck, the trebles have a clear, soft sweetness to them, although you can still extract a sound with a sharper attack with the right technique.  The guitar is fairly loud, but not \\""concert level\\"", although I hope this will improve as the spruce opens up over time.<br /><br />If you are used to cedar tops, the spruce tops take a little getting used to.  Debates rage on and on about spruce vs. cedar, and the exact qualities of the sound of either top depends greatly on the guitar's construction, especially how the top in thinned, tuned, and braced.  That said, my favorite guitars have been the spruce tops, couldn't explain exactly why. However, if you like the \\""spruce sound\\"", this guitar delivers.  I haven't been able to compare it directly to the C10 in spruce, though recordings and videos Ihave seen suggest the C10 may have a bit of a harder tone to it, likely because of the solid rosewood B/S.  Some have opined that Spruce pairs best with rosewood, but I think this is subjective.  The spruce/mahogany combination in the C9 SP/MH yields a beautiful, expressive tone that should please a great many people."

3202,RTLMCWC2T9Y07,4,"Neerly perfect for the money and  my needs I am using a hackintosh which is the macintosh OS on a pc. So I needed a good sound card for my pro audio software. This Firebox sounds great. It is loud without distorting. It is so easy to get at all of the knobs and it was picked up with no problems by the Mac os. I did have to load the latest drivers in order to get sync.     I would have given it 5 stars but unfortunately since it is a small box, it not rack mounted. Well the 1/4\\"" input plugs on the front are too tight on my unit so it requires a great deal of force in order to get them out.    This is something I'm willing to overlook unless it later becomes a problem.    I would definitely recommend this product. I just wish protools would enable this product like they do with the m audio. I read mixed reviews on the m audio so I got this instead. So I just use logic and reason."

6581,R13TH1TJK3C87W,5,"Price to Performance Ratio Is Through The Roof Ranging from $110 to $150 ($200 on the manufacturer's website, but that is a bit too highly priced) these are extremely satisfactory for the price. At this price range I haven't found a single headphone that is almost perfect except for these. They are highly durable, stylish, comfortable, and most importantly sound very good. Out of the box and a few days after, I can say that I wasn't too impressed, but coming from regular Apple in-ears I didn't know what to look for or what good sound actually was. Now after spending 2 weeks with these (listening frequently) I can confidently say they are amazing and easily achieve top-tier status for their price. I also compared these with other Beats By Dre models and I almost immediately came to appreciate these for what they were. These don't have a bone-rattling QUANTITY of bass, but they have a clear, sufficient, punchy and detailed range of bass from the high hitting beats to the pounding of drums and even low, rumbly frequencies that Beats can't even achieve because of the low-end roll-off. Vocals come in not sounding right next to you, but maybe as though you were a few rows back in a concert. Instruments and treble and high parts of the song are crystal clear, they  aren't fatiguing to listen to, and I find it highly detailed. I found large amounts of bass fatiguing to listen to after about an hour so I appreciate the somewhat flatter response of these where the bass hits home just right. Give these a while and you will come to love them."

5793,RDICFH3NA9YFX,5,"The Secret Weapon against unwanted noise The ISP G String Decimator is, first of all, appropriately NAMED. It truly decimates unwanted guitar noise.<br /><br />Before I bought mine, I watched A/B-type comparison videos on YouTube and found this one to be the best: [...] It's narrated in Spanish or Portugese, but don't let that deter you... his captions are spot-on. The most powerful part of the video is how he demonstrates, without argument, how the Decimator does NOT decay or clamp the natural resonance of the sounds you want to hear.<br /><br />This pedal will never come off of my pedal board. That, however, does not mean I have it on all the time.<br /><br />I don't play with tons of distortion, but I do play combinations of single-coil, P-90 and humbucking guitars and this pedal is like a waiter in a fine restaurant... ready to serve you, but never in the way. I have the MXR Fullbore Metal pedal with what is supposed to be a noise gate built in, and the controls for the MXR are complicated by comparison to the Decimator.<br /><br />The Decimator simply rolls ON or OFF the noise reduction that is required without complicated knobs and/or settings.<br /><br />I'm not smart enough to use modeling amps and pedals that try to do too much (e.g. Fullbore Metal) have too high a \\""hassle-factor\\"" for me.<br /><br />The G-String Decimator does require you to learn about the best way to properly use it in your rig.

Granted, that input is colored from my own experience... I used extra instrument cables to get me by until I could order longer patch cables.<br /><br />Some helpful links:<br /><br />From ISP:<br />[...]<br /><br />Forum-based link:<br />[...]<br /><br />Go to the video (if links are allowed) or go to Yoo Toob and search \\""g string decimator\\"" by \\""hermeticoguitar\\"". YOU WILL SAVE A TON OF TIME by doing so; and you'll realize that he did the video exactly correctly.<br /><br />So much can be said about this pedal, that I'd be waxing on here without any reason if you see the video for yourself.<br /><br />Bottom line: No other pedal delivers what this pedal delivers because of the way the pedal isolates the guitar.<br /><br />A top performer. Expensive? That depends on how much you value frittering time away on other solutions whose price is lower.<br /><br />Hear what this pedal can do ONE TIME and you'll find yourself selling other gear to fund this purchase.<br /><br />\m/ ROCK ON!"
7843,R1Z5K9EQI3MTSZ,4,"Very pleased with this piano I have now owned this piano for about 3 weeks and am very happy with it.  I learnt piano for about 10 years as a kid, then continued playing as a hobby until about 20 years ago when I sold my upright piano. Now, having decided to take up the piano again, I was immediately impressed with the sound and feel of this piano. While you can't really say that it sounds and feels 100%like a modern acoustic piano, it's still far better than any second hand acoustic piano that I have ever owned in the past. My only criticism of the sound, is that it's 2 x 6 watt speakers aren't really large enough, so the volume needs to be wound up to 100% to obtain acceptable sound across the complete range of keys, however as 90% of my playing has been through good quality headphones, this hasn't been a major problem. The sound through the headphones is excellent and you forget that you have headphones on after a while.<br /><br />I chose Yamaha mainly owing to their consistently good reviews, particularly with respect to authentic sound and key action & feel. The YDP-141 is a nice piece of furniture in any room and comes with a matching Yamaha bench and built-in keyboard cover.<br /><br />As other reviewers have said, the boxed package is heavy. I was only just able to transport it home in the back of our SUV and with the aid of a trolley, was only just able to lug it up a flight of stairs by myself. It assembled easily but I'd recommend getting someone to assist holding the keyboard section when it is being assembled and attached to the base. Once assembled, it can be moved around fairly easily but it's a job for two people.<br /><br />It comes with \\""bells and whistles\\"" such as 6 voices, metronome, ability to record and play back your performances, 50 in-built songs, MIDI ports, etc, but while these features are impressive on paper or in the showroom, they are quickly forgotten. What really counts is that it performs it's core functions very well."

When you apply a drop to your peg, it feels like it fuses to the hole, and I panicked when that happened and thought I had destroyed my violin and the ability to tune it.  I rubbed some of it off with a wet q-tip, but that didn't help, and so I gave up and walked away.  Then I came back about 30 mins later, and at that point I was able to turn the peg (although it was still quite difficult).  So just a warning, they work but once applied it makes the peg very difficult to turn.  The violin does stay in tune though!"

6807,R1CJ9O325GSYES,5,"Stick with the good stuff Although Iâ€™m not a banjo player, as a musical instrument collector, I try to keep all my instruments in good shape and ready to play. Thatâ€™s why over the years, I've come to trust a number of Dâ€™Addario products, from ukulele strings and straps, to saxophone reeds, to guitar, and now, banjo strings. Their products are always made to the highest standard with the best materials, and packaged securely in an easy to use format. These banjo strings prove to be no exception.<br /><br />They are loop end strings and come pre-sorted in five envelopes inside the flat folded cardboard package. The packaging is advertised as corrosion resistant, and I believe it, as every string came out shiny and clean. The finish is excellent and they look great. If I could play a banjo, Iâ€™d tell you how they sound, but all I can say is, they are easy to string, easy to tune, and they sound lively and vibrant to a guy who canâ€™t do much if any pickinâ€™. (Iâ€™m good at grinninâ€™, though!) I believe these would make great strings for just about any non-professional banjo player, and probably would satisfy many pros as well, which is why I say that Dâ€™addario has lived up to its reputation and these banjo strings are worth five stars."

2939,RAXCJCM2ZQB8S,4,"Why Crown XTi power amps are special This is the third Crown XTi power amp that I've bought. This particular one is rolling around on an A/V cart along with a video projector, a DVD player, a small mixing console, and a pair of EV ZX-1 speakers.    The two things that set XTI power amps apart is their light weight and their built-in DSP.     Yes, Crown XTI power amps sound good, but I think this is something that we should be able to just take for granted on in products from first tier pro sound manufacturers like Crown.     However, this kind of power (> 1 KW) in an 18 pound 2 RU pound package is a bit special. Most traditional pro sound power amps with this kind of power might weigh about twice as much. The convenience in terms of having to carry and man handle an amp goes way up when the weight goes under 20 pounds.     From the comments I read, very few people actually take advantage of the DSPs in Crown XTI power amps. Shame, shame! Fact is that a sound system implemented with XTi power amps typcially needs no speaker managment add-ons, no external crossovers, no external equalizers, no matter how complex. Each XTI has a zero-extra-cost field-programmable DSP-based self-management facility, including crossovers, equalizers, power limiting, and even bass synthesis.     I have an old Dell laptop that I've loaded with two free downloads one from Microsoft and one from Crown, that is my amplifier programmer. I just start the \\""Band Manager\\"" software, cable it up to the USB power on my XTi power amps, and I'm in the driver's seat. The GUI software \\""finds\\"" as many Xti amps as you have cabled up, up to 8. You can select the amp you want configure, and then the real fun starts. The various crossovers, limiters, and equalizers each have their own easy-to-use GUI. Mouse away!  Before you disconnect the software, be sure to lock out the front panel of the amp. If someone is going to mess with your adjustements, let them find their own laptop!    Here's a practcial situation. I love EV ZX series speakers, I'mmost of the way through owning a dozen of them. In my opinon the ZX-1 is the real honey of the line. They also weigh only 18 pounds, but they can take every watt that this XTi puts out and turn it into clean sound. Everybody who has worked with ZX-1s will tell you that as good as they sound all by themselves, they really sing if you can tailor their response to their environment. On stands? Hanging on the wall? Whatever. Speaker response curves are not a one-size-fits-all situation. Depending on your application, turning the midrange down a few dB, and kicking up the ends of the spectrum a bit can make them sound like they are far larger and heavier than they are. Enter the Xti power amp. The tools are all there. No casual user or operator can see anything to play with. The system belongs to you. Just bring your netbook or laptop. I wonder when Crown will come up with a iPad version of Band Manager..."

I bought this because my daughter's piano teacher had told us to get a voice recorder, I picked this one based on the good comments and its price, for some reason, I always think that you get what you pay for. It was proven wrong this time though, had to return it for a refund. Here are the reasons:<br /><br />1. No built-in speaker, you have to listen to the recording via the earphones or by downloading it to your computer.<br /><br />2. Little hard to operate, I am pretty good at using those so-call gadgets since I am the one who uses them all the time in the family, but I found this one not as intuitively designed as some other items I have used. Plus the display is a little too small.<br /><br />3.

Calling it &#34;leather&#34; is pretty misleading; it appears to be &#34;bonded&#34; leather, which is basically leather dust pressed together with glue. It's nothing like any real leather strap I've ever had; thin, brittle, and ugly are the best words to describe it. I have lots of guitars and several Fender straps...the woven ones are top of the line in my opinion. I would have returned this immediately but was so disgusted with it that I tossed it in a corner and didn't find it until it was too late to return. A real disappointment for something with the Fender brand on it.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good leather strap I'd go to Etsy...I've found several nice bison hide straps there for not much more than this cardboard-feeling &#34;leather&#34; product from Fender."

3434,R1VAXKEL0E0MHF,3,"A little finicky The internal DR40 mics are very susceptible to wind, so I obviously sought out a windscreen for better recordings outside, specifically when I'm just trying to get some general ambiance.  The windscreen definitely cuts down on the sound, so that's good.  Most of my testing of it came during the winter months, when the wind was really blowing.  There was definitely still noticeable sound, but if it weren't for the windscreen those recordings would've been nothing but noise.  It took the noise to a level that I could work with in editing.  I haven't had a chance to try it with more typical weather conditions, but I'm assuming it will perform even better then.<br /><br />However, this thing is really annoying to use.  It took me about five minutes to actually get the thing on top, and then you better hope that you don't accidentally touch it too hard.  The elastic is pretty taut, which is good for keeping it secure, but it's also not a very long (maybe that's the wrong descriptor?) windscreen, so if you don't get it on just right it will slowly slide up and then pop off.  It took some wrestling, and some cursing of my fingers for not being nimbler, but I finally got it on.  Unfortunately, you will soon notice that it obscures the headphone jack, and makes using the input switch (line/mic/mic+phantom) a little risky for the aforementioned \\""don't touch it\\"" reasons.  There's really no way to fix it, because if you don't pull the screen down far enough, it will slide off on it's own, but if you do pull it down far enough it starts to mess with functionality.  If anyone has any suggestions, maybe I'm just using it wrong.<br /><br />I can't really recommend a different product, because there isn't any other option...but this gets the job done.  I would've preferred something that used a suspender sort of system, with two bands that you hooked around the bottom of the recorder up to the top.  Yeah, it would look goofy as hell, but it would be a lot easier to use."
1888,R2COE9326HFIIE,4,"Bought this at it's release I bought this item when it first came out and I think this Amazon page needs a review with a few years behind the product.<br /><br />When I bought this multi-tracker everything came with a bit of a learning curve, though it wasn't too bad, you still need to read the manual or else have the knowledge/guess at what all the nodules and buttons do.  At any rate, this is a very easy piece of equipment to learn and with its various settings you can get just about any sound you want out of this hardware, it's actually quite amazing.<br /><br />So far I've recorded 2 demos and one full length record on this little gizmo and the people who buy my records never guess that I produced it by myself at home, using nothing more than a few instruments and effects and my handy-dandy fostex mkII.<br /><br />There's no fuzz or hiss, even if you dub all 8 channels and you'd be hardpressed to make something sound bad unless the rest of your equipment isn't up to par.<br />Bottom line is that this is a great product for a great price and I promise you can make studio quality recordings with cheap gear as long as this lil beast is in your arsenal.<br /><br />Also I have to say after years of daily use this multitracker is no worse for wear.<br /><br />The only gripes I have are the LCD screen being too flat and hard to read at an angle, and the knobs can sometimes be inaccurate, and that you will need a flashcard much larger than what it comes with, so buy one ahead of time...

1127,R1DEPU3OOJDGFS,5,"If you know how to EQ and add Reverb, you've got a killer Oud! Perfect for Live application with a band. This is a fine instrument. The craftsmanship is just amazing.

The face of the Oud (Soundboard) is made of Cedar wood, warm indeed to compensate the &#34;not that great pickup system&#34; compared to the Multioud Ambience.

7283,R1IH20BNO0BE5V,5,"Does just what I needed it to do. I picked up this guy to give me a headphone out for my own personal monitor on my guitar pedal board. The size is perfect, and I really only needed one 1/4\\"" input, so the extra one is a bonus. I've been quite pleased with the versatility of the unit. It does add a very slight bit of background noise to the output, but for my use (live performance), it isn't a factor at all. My only gripe on this box is the power cable input into the box. It's one of those hokey 4-pin things like an S-video cable. Lame! But that ain't enough to make me dog the rating on this thing. It's a good mini-mixer for the money (side rant - wish it wasn't made in China, but at this size and price? Never gonna happen)"

6627,R6SZWUWEU8MVK,1,"SECOND one to split! I ordered a didg from this company, received well and good and was pleased with it. This was not my first didgeridoo, my first being from Australia made from eucalyptus, and I was happy that this was not pvc or other synthetics but bamboo. However it split all the way up and down in a matter of days. This has happened frequently so I found out, with Meinl's didgeridoos. I opted to exchange it and Amazon handled it in true and proper fashion. I received my second on and in less time it has developed a split near the mouth of the instrument. I am sending this one back and will not order from Meinl again. I do hope you have better luck with them than I did."

789,R3FVUB5SM6WH14,5,Can't ask for more! We got this unit to allow the children to learn to play the piano.  We are fortunate to have an instructor who comes to the house.  It worked right out of the box without much set up.  To my completely untrained ears it sounds like a real piano.  It's sturdy and professional looking and has quite a few buttons we've yet to explore.  The headphones are a mother's dream!  The different tones and songs are a blast for the children.  We've had lots of dance parties.  It was a good price for our budget.  The instructor himself thought it was a fine instrument and said it would take the children far into their lessons.
8152,R1IRUGD3ZVYHCE,5,"the pleather went bad and started to harden and crack These are basically a must-have for people with older ATH-m50's that still used pleather padding. After using my m50's for roughly a year, the pleather went bad and started to harden and crack. I have been using the new pads for a few days, and one thing I have noticed is that they are much more comfortable and forgiving for people with glasses. The old pads did not conform to the glasses, but instead pushed them into the sides of my head, causing discomfort over a long period of time(roughly 1-2 hours).<br /><br />People who own the new version of ath-m50s, this is probably not a worthy upgrade. The soft pads on the new m50's are more than comfortable enough to compete with these valour pads."
7857,R1IZ0BXTSZB98K,5,"Simple and effective, great for Shure SM7B Knowing that the preamps on a couple of my audio interfaces don't offer a ton of gain, I picked up the CL-1 the same day I ordered my Shure SM7B (whose manual recommends using preamps that can boost by 50db) to be on the safe side. I heard some concerns about the Cloudlifter device- people saying that it cut bass frequencies or otherwise colored the sound, so on my first day of ownership I did some tests. I recorded live vocals and an amped drum loop- first through just my interface's preamp, and then through the Cloudlifter, while lowering the gain on the interface to level match the non-Cloudlifter recordings. The interface I used for my test recordings was an RME Fireface UFX. I engaged the phantom power on the mic input when doing the Cloudlifter recordings (to power the CL-1), and disabled it for the straight-to-interface recordings.<br /><br />I could not hear any difference at all between the recordings, and using the analysis features of both Audacity and Wavelab, I could find no visible differences between the recordings in terms of frequency spectrum used. I am fully convinced the CL-1 does exactly what it's supposed to: Deliver 25db of clean, transparent gain to your mic's signal before it ever hits your interface or mixing desk."

The mikes would just drop lower, and lower, and lower, until we were talking into it with our heads on the table. I bought this and a new clutch to resolve the issue. We have to fiddle with it a little to get it just right, but what a difference. Now, when we adjust the mike, it sits just where it should for each user.

6872,R2RLF1RGM6L2BY,3,"Good preamp / bad power supply I purchased the PP400 preamp for my new receiver which does not have a phono input (preamp), like most others in the same situation. The preamp is very nicely packaged. There is too much HUMMM. My background is electronics so I know what the reason is from the start. I had suspected it to be the case even before I purchased it. I cut the cord between the power supply and the preamp and inserted a filter circuit in between. So much for the warranty! For those who can understand it, the circuit is just a one transistor capacitance multiplier. The ripple (hum) was reduced from 50mv to under 2mv. The solution is not perfect but now I can live with it. I found that experimenting with grounding also help to reduce hum. Try attaching the ground wire to different points on the receiver chassie. Be sure to reduce the volume as you move the grounding around so you will not blow out the speakers or your ear drums.    I am rather surprised, after reading the other reviews that not more hum complains were launchased. With that much hum on the power supply, hum is unavoidable. I am giving a full 5 stars on the preamp itself. The lack of filtering on the power supply dropped the rating to 3 stars overall."

I purchased them because my fiance kept bugging me for them, but I was skeptical until I finally decided to try them out. As soon as they got here, we set them up (which took about 5 minutes) and when we stuck them to our wall, they began falling after about 5 minutes. The backing was just not sticky enough to stay stuck for a long time. So, we took our trusty staple gun and stapled them to our wall. That did the trick! Other than that minor inconvenience, the lights are worth every penny! I am amazed at how bright they are. We used the music settings and they all work GREAT!

I put in a replacement good battery and a few days later it was also dead.  So now I take out the battery between used so it doesn't die.  It does have a port where you can use a wired power supply, but this is not included with this product and I havn't wanted to bother trying to figure out which power supply to buy.  The battery connections in the back feel super delicate and I worry about the wiring coming apart from changing the battery so often..  The back door battery cover is kinda clunky as well.  The unit feels solid, I'm not worried about the case breaking from normal use, it is made out of plastic though.<br /><br />That said, the product works great and its way cheaper than buying separate pedals."

3006,R64YPNAMDE5OY,3,"For Screen Clarity its a C+ I waited in line on the 21st for my second iPhone and spent the weekend without a case or screen protector.  I then ordered this cover as an experiment.  Immediately upon installation I could tell that screen protection would be very good.  It felt thick and durable.  But at the same time I instantly noticed that the incredible iPhone's Retina display had been compromised.  My wife refused to place it on her new iPhone 5 after seeing mine because she didn't want to compromise the quality of the phone's display.  Therefore, if you bought your iPhone 5 to read lots of text or enjoy lots of high quality video, you will be disappointed. If you really need to see your phone in bright daylight, other reviewers feel this protector is a definite improvement. I still have the protector on my phone but will probably look for a quality replacement."

This Keyboard taught me a valuable lesson: If you want 76 keys, you really want 88 keys. 76 keys leaves you about four keys short on the bottom end, especially for you piano players. I really like this keyboard, but I'm also shopping for a more professional 88 key Yamaha keyboard"

1197,R3Q7B7HQNOZE1Y,5,"Surprising! This is a PLAYER, not a BRAGGER. I have a studio full of PREMIUM guitars, each acquired for their acclaimed tone and prestige.. I \\""accidentally\\"" made an offer on this guitar, and it was accepted. I broke the news to my wife and told her that it could be my 5 yr old son's first big boy guitar.. That was the story -- until I took it out of the box. First impression: a Les Paul-lite, 2 vol pots, 2 tone pots tap-able (like a Paul Trad Pro II). Versatile pick-ups: a \\""rocker\\"" in the bridge with a \\""mellow vintage\\"" in the neck. A large radius neck (flatter) with medium frets... Out of the box showed perfect factory set-up - intonations spot on, low action with zero buzz. My nagging question was, \\""What would a guitar with MEDIUM frets, a large radius, and low action play like?\\"" The answer, \\""Like no other!\\"" I've always esteemed a guitar by its MSRP value, \\""You get what you pay for.\\"" This is true for many, many things, but NOT this particular Schecter model.... This Solo-6 Special does it all with no loss in string bending or speed, usually due to the medium frets. In my opinion, bending and sliding is much easier on this guitar with the added benefit of actually feeling the fretboard! (You know when you fret a jumbo fretted guitar with a lot of finger strength, you push the note sharp? Not an issue here) The solid neck/body sustains like a reputable Les Paul. The Schecter tuners proved to be no different than Grovers; stays in tune. The bridge pup has clarity in its drive allowing a 6 string power chord, yet also allows pinch harmonics to squeal unmercifully! This guitar even reduces the demand of my pedalboard. I set the bridge pup for 10/10 drive/tone, and the neck p100 to single coil dark tone. With the Les Paul like 3 position tone switch on the upper hip, I can simply toggle between clean and drive with no knob adjustment. Less stress and more enjoyment!<br /><br />I never write reviews. I don't want many people to buy this guitar because I feel like I have a secret. Funny, I paid $420 for mine, and itis my \\""go-to\\"" guitar now, while my next cheapest guitar is 5 x's the value of this. Gibson ES-359 Custom, Fender '52 Tele, Taylor Custom SB, Taylor T3B, Ibanez Prestige (80s), Fender Custom Tele... These are now objects of art more than objects to play..... Good grief! The reason I am even reviewing this is because I am surfing Amazon and Ebay looking for ANOTHER Solo6 Special as a future back-up as these are no longer built.....<br /><br />Kind of funny to think that I am playing a benefit this Friday with this Solo 6 Special as my \\""main,\\"" with a $3400 Gibson Custom sitting in a stand as back-up... Rock on and God Bless!"
4022,RJGYC72GP964W,5,"Real Sound for Real Tiny Humans I just bought this for my almost 4-year old daughter for Christmas. It's fantastic. It's got nice sound from a perfectly balanced, 1/2 size guitar. We added a strap button to the bottom so little one can walk around and rock out. She's already learning a couple of notes, soon onto chords. I did buy better strings to put on it, though I haven't changed them yet. The metal wrapped vinyl strings did seem a little rusty in certain spots, as mentioned by other reviewers, but they play and hold a tune...sort of. I expect the tuning to stabilize on this instrument. The tuning pegs and mechanism seems pretty tight, so I'm confident that it's really just about stretchy strings breaking in. It looks great, sounds full. I'm absolutely thrilled with the price and quality of this guitar.  Depending on how you treat it, It's not a toy. It's a tiny starter guitar."

5874,R21NQHRMO3E94L,4,Very Very Nice Really nice headphones. I can hear just about everything very clearly. Nice long chord for your studio. I like the fact that there is a sort of spring around the cord coming from the headphone jack to support it from bending too much and shorting. I was hoping for a slight bit more bass but it's definitely not bad. Maybe it's just because they probably have no built in equalizer presets which is a good thing for recording.
3616,R2TONDQRYOO68E,5,"9 out of 10 Well, it took me a week of researching customer and tech reviews, but I finally settled on the Sennheiser EH 350s and I have been exceptionally happy with my choice.    The primary point of purchasing new headphones is because I play a bass guitar and I wanted a pair in order to hear the nuances of the music I am playing.  Also, I own a couple MP3 players and I wanted some headphones to use with them as well.    The first pair I bought, just willy-nilly really, was the Skullcandy Skullcrusher \\""subwoofer\\"" headphones.  Big mistake, it was the worst $45 I ever spent.  Their mids and highs were lackluster, and the so-called \\""bass\\"" was really just vibration with little really true bass frequency.  Sure I could \\""feel\\"" the vibration of the bass, but it was impossible to pick out individual notes because it drowned everything out.  Then my dog chewed them up because he was disgusted as I was, and although I share his enthusiasm I was sad to see I couldn't return them :)    Anyway, the EH 350 is like night and day with the Skullcandy's.  The Sennheiser's really try to reproduce the original studio sound, hence why they are called monitor headphones, and they do an excellent job of it.  The sound is flat, as the sound is not artificially boosted, which also means that music that comes out of it will sound slightly quiet.  But I found that if I just jack up the volume on my preamp or mp3 player the sound comes out strong and loud.  I use a 30GB Zune, and it has plenty of power to blast out a sound that is just tolerable at highest volume.  This is good because some headphones out there have troubles producing a good volume with mobile devices.  Now onto the sound quality.    The mids and especially the highs are very well defined with these headphones.  They shine through with exceptional quality and precision, and although the highs are a bit stronger they actually balance well with each other.  The highs were a little too high upon first purchase, but after a couple days itmellowed out nicely without losing any of the previous power.  After only a two hour burn in, you will notice an appreciable improvement in sound quality.  I am excited to think how these will feel a month from now.     Of course, I really bought them for the bass.  Upon first purchase the bass was a little too quiet for me, or perhaps it might be better to say that the highs drowned it out too much.  Actually I think it was a mix of both, but now that a few days have passed the bass has become excellent.  Some reviews listed this product had a bass that was slightly too quiet.  The fact is, that is how bass usually sounds in the studio.  The key with bass is that you train your ear to hear it, rather then just try to buy headphones that artificially boost the bass.  If you want to hear a tight, true bass sound that has the power to blow your mind away, go out and buy a pair of $1000 dollar monitor speakers and feel the love.  Otherwise, you wont be able to beat the well balanced richness of the EH 350's bass.    The end effect?  Although the sound of monitor headphones can tend to be flat, the EH 350 sound comes out exceptionally well balanced.  Although I couldn't call them \\""golden with richness\\"", they will however produce a sound that is so accurate to original studio that you will pick up hidden nuances and stylizations that you will have never heard before.  With these headphones, you can hear each of the individual instruments and voices of your favorite music instead of them all muddled together like other headphones who might sound more rich.  I would highly recommend these headphones to any musicians who are looking for monitor headphones on a budget but who don't want to sacrifice sound quality.  I also recommend these headphones to anyone who has ever wanted to play an instrument or sing, these headphones make it easy to tune your ear to individual instruments and puts forth and incredibly accurate note and pitch.    Note however that the EH 350s, like most monitor headphones, are open ear.  That means that sound is allowed to pass freely out of the headphones.  This allows the sound to extend past the headphones and makes it so that the shape of the headphone cup does not distort the sound like a lot of closed-ear headphones will do, and it has the additional benefit of keeping airflow within the cups, so your ears never sweat or become uncomfortable.  On the other hand, although the EH 350s are pretty good at keeping at least moderate noise levels out, other people around will be able to hear what you are listening, especially in quiet or small quarters.  These might not be the best headphones for you if you are wanting to take them on the bus or be in crowds.  Some headphones are large and noticeable.  I have noticed that the Sennheiser's are small and stylish enough to at least go largely unnoticed, but I wouldn't call them attractive.    But how do they fit?  It is true that Sennheiser's are slightly tight as many reviewers have stated.  But this is how they are designed.  I am a male with a reasonably sized head.  I wont say I have the biggest head out there, but I have been known to have a sizeable noggin.  Although the EH 350s sit tight, they do not sit uncomfortably so.  In fact, the tight fit is actually a necessity to the open ear system of the headphones and improves sound quality, and as I stated previously this makes them able to reasonably block out moderate external sounds without losing the benefit of open ear headphones.  They also are slightly too bulky to take jogging and undoubtably would be uncomfortable if you took them running with you.    One other point before I move on, the cups on these headphones are slightly small.  I would say I have slightly smaller then average sized ears for a man and they go around my ear and sit on my skull, but people with large ears might find the cushions lying on the ears instead of around them.  It is also very important to note that the leather cushion on the top of the headphones should rest firmly upon the top of your head as to hold some of the weight.  If you over adjust these headphones the weight will fall on the cups and your ears will begin to rest on the hard plastic within.  After about an hour, this will cause discomfort.  This is, of course, easily alleviated by simply properly adjusting them to fit your head.    What about value?  At prices well under $100 dollars, these headphones are easily worth twice their price.  I don't think any headphones at any price will be able to beat the 350s precision.  You will have to begin looking at the $200 dollar price range if you want headphones that will have the precision of the 350s and have a more full bodied richness.  I hear the 595s might be what your looking for if you have dough to spend.     Overall, the Sennheiser EH 350s get a five star, 9 out of 10.  With a perfect balance of precision and value, you can't beat these headphones if you have less then a hundred dollars to spend.    Oh, and thankfully, my dog has decided to spare these headphones... for now..."

3341,R2O8991WPDGE8E,5,"fit and finish and set up (including intonation) were absolutely perfect right out of the box A couple of the pickup cover screws were not fully screwed down. Took all of two seconds to fix that. Otherwise, fit and finish and set up (including intonation) were absolutely perfect right out of the box. Note that I purchased another G&L a few months back and returned it for fit and finish problems. Conclusion, based on two samples, G&L quality control is a bit lacking.  Body wise, don't let the name fool you, this is a full size Fender tele clone, both as to the body shape and the 25.5 scale neck. The &#34;Jr.&#34; is a reference to a Gibson product, again, it should not be taken to mean this is an undersized or youth guitar. This does have 22 frets as opposed to the traditional tele 21 and the radius is 12 as opposed to 9.5. Still, think tele body and you won't be surprised. More accurately, think basic tele body because this thing has no fancy binding or fancy paint. In fact, from just two feet away, despite the color richness of the butterscotch headstock/neck and the â€˜mahogany reddishâ€™ of the mahogany,  itâ€™s a very basic, even stripped looking guitar, as the black pickups kind of disappear and the subtle beauty of the mahogany can only be appreciated up close. Very close.  Appearances aside, and in case you don't know tele's,  know you are getting a comfortable, easy to handle, easy to play guitar. This one, I would say, even a bit more comfortable and a bit easier to play because of the lighter mahogany body and the 12 degree radius. That said, some complain the G&L's heavily glossed neck a bit slow. I donâ€™t have a problem with it but if you do you can always lightly sand/steel wool it to a faster satin finish, leaving the front of the headstock alone so as to retain the rich color and the G&L logos.  Sound wise, we have a whole other animal as this thing carries two beefed up clones of Gibson's storied P90 single coils.  In case you don't know P90's, understand that Gibson never really pulled off the single coil thing, that few if any P90's soundlike any Fender single coil. These are no exception. While you can dial in a decent representation of tele 'twang' at the top end, this guitar and these G&L P90's are best played as and described as 'punchy' mid range pieces.  Don't get me wrong, G&L did a great job of matching up the electronics on this guitar. You can dial up a nice sparkle to a very, very dark with practically no mud anywhere in the range. All with no hum or other extraneous noises. In other words, twisting the tone knob actually produces different useable tones, something that cannot be said for all guitars, regardless the price range.  So, this guitar is versatile, but in its own way, a P90 way. Not PAF, (true or the all too common in this price range â€œmuddyâ€ Epiphone PAF), not Telecaster twang or Strat quack, not Rickenbacker clean and chimey, not an ArtCore rich and bluesy.  Not EMG metal. Just a rich P90 punch, plain and simple, nicely balanced across the two pickups and potent enough to carry some gain.  Also note that the P90 flavor continues when you turn up the gain. Perhaps a little less rich, but it is definitely there. Understand, I donâ€™t use a lot of distortion nor a bunch of pedals so YMMV but to me this thing sounds as good under mild to medium distortion as anything I own, better than most, way, way better than some.  Finally, realize that this combination of tele clone and Gibson P90 clone is a bit unusual, although G&L has done it before, albeit at a much higher, limited edition, price range. In fact there has been some grumbling in G&L owner circles that this model  'devalued' their previously purchased â€˜collectorâ€™ P90/tele clones.  Finally, finally, note that I played the guitar through a variety of medium range amps. I didnâ€™t have any low end stuff available at the time and I donâ€™t own any high end, Mesa quality, or high end vintage stuff. It really liked my Blues Jr. III as well as a Roland GA112. Same for a Vox AC15c1. The only thing it didnâ€™t sound good with was a cheapo Marshall emulator head hooked to a 12&#34; Celestion 70/80  which, interestingly, I flat out love and which is my absolute favorite Strat amp.  So who needs one of these?  I personally would  recommend this to any beginner. In my opinion, this is a much better place to start than a Les Paul or a Tele or Strat or a shredder as it sounds good straight up. You donâ€™t need a fancy amp or dropped tunings or super accurate setups. Itâ€™s light enough you donâ€™t need a custom made six inch wide strap. No fancy controls, one tone, one volume.  Just pick it up and play it, the â€˜punchâ€™ will make you and your exercises sound better and sounding better may well keep you playing longer.  I would also recommend it to any experienced player wanting something fun to play and fun to listen to while plugging the hole between the PAF and tele/strat sounds. However, if â€˜plain janeâ€™ appearances bother you, you best pony up another grand or so for the USA limited edition."

3288,RWC05L6TO9OF3,4,"Good for metal amp pedals. This is a hi-gain amp, you canâ€™t get any sound without using the gain, raising the gain from minimal to 9 oâ€™clock gives you a little distorted sound, like maybe for hard blues, at 11o'clock you get an AC/DC sound, after 12'clock you are into metal territory, after 3 o'clock it gets really noisy.<br />Another thing comes when you plug a pedal, thatâ€™s other level, I have a RP 15 and it sounds WONDERFULL, everything from clean, blues, rock, metal, etc, sounds great, this amp was made for metal and it can handle every distorted pedal, soâ€¦it is a good valve amp, YES if are a metal head and NOT if you want a clean amp.<br />It is a good amp with pedals, no so great without them.<br />Another thingâ€¦.it is as heavy as a obliged marriageâ€¦.soâ€¦really heavy."

However I was very disappointed upon the unboxing and end result of the product. With one of the stands there is a VERY loud groaning/squeaking sound and the second stand that I put together fell apart. This however allowed me to see the inside of the stand. the metal shaft is encased in two halves of rounded plastic in which are two very resistant springs, this is what keeps the shaft from falling down. However it is so tight that it makes the shaft difficult to move inside of the column creating a lot of resistance, therefore when you spin it, that resistance results in this vibrating squeaking. In my opinion this is a poor and cheap design, partially why they can be sold cheaper than Manhasset. If you have the money go for the Manhasset, if you expect to be needing to move the desk around rather than keeping it in a fixed position don't get this particular Hamilton. I would say these are great for a sturdy practice stand, however not for performance as the functionality of the product design is, well, crappy."

Works very well to protect against buckle rash, BUT, on both of my guitars I used this on, I experienced the gradual fading of the finish from UV on the unprotected part of the guitar, allowing the outline of the scratch pad to be quite visible.  So keep your guitars in the cases, not on a stand in the living room!"
3322,R3SAC9C9R945KS,5,Beautiful This is my first polymer (plastic) whistle and I would rank amongst my other whistles as one of my best!
6319,R222FCTP203UP,5,Great shelf - a little pricey but works great The holes/slots are nothing like the pictures. The shelf the was delivered for me was very perforated - lots of air movement possible. If you wanted a more solid shelf then this is not the one for you.
2648,R15WTV2YC0JWSB,5,Five Stars Thank you from Don
3977,R2C1NLTFWEPJ0H,5,"Travels well... I bought this for my daughter who was attending a summer music camp and needed a stand that traveled well. Our car was packed to the brim, but this fit nicely and it is also very sturdy, so it is now her everyday practice stand in her room.  It is easy to put together, break down, and reassemble.  You won't be disappointed."

8270,R19QAMY7DYOGIU,4,"This tuner does everything I want it to. I use this tuner on several bass guitars, some with alternative tunings and it works great. I'll probably buy more of these because they are so convenient."
6151,R1DQVNMHVKL17Q,5,Five Stars I really liked the sound. Good product
6570,R1LSW56ZVUHCMF,5,"Great quality for low price We use these audio recorders for our undergraduate art program because they are cheap and still get the job done. The casing over the micro-SD card is a little flimsy, so we put tape over it and instructed the students to only move files on/off the recorder with the USB cord (works great!)."
185,R2EZRAMZSTQAKH,5,Good Product Use for church services. Didnt have a big budget but didnt need it. This product works great for what we use it for at a great price. Maybe not great for a rock & roll show but perfect for us. Fast shipping. Product as advertised. Would buy again.
7095,R1XL05AGWLE2I6,5,very solid mic.. worth spending the extra money ... very solid mic .. worth spending the extra money to get this one vs another cheaper mic that i bought and just fell apart a few days later cause the kids dropped it .. i know they should not drop the mic's but  worth getting something that can withstand the kids &#34;tough love&#34; .. this one does well
3820,R1Y3P3YVVSEJBZ,5,"Small Guitar Hello, this is a great guitar for my 21 month old toddler. The size is perfect and the price was right!"
4960,RI31GB2XDG1SK,5,Five Stars Arrived in good time.  Color tone was good.  Very happy with it.
315,R1RGKZLY3ZXBP6,5,"Terrific Purchase This was a terrific purchase.  Thanks to the customer service people at Kenwood who recommended I replace my turntable with this Audio Technica turntable I am now able to play my 33 & a 1/3 and 45 rpm records on my five-component Kenwood stereo system I have had for 27 years.  Then turntable is easy to operate, looks good and fits right in.  Nice price too."
3210,R911TJ4C7N9V1,5,Five Stars Beautiful violin for $$ and sound.
304,R395INQ0PI40U6,5,"Exactly what I was looking for! I have a Mackie Profx8 and this was exactly what I was looking for.  The build quality looks and feels great.  All the components including zippers felt solid.  My mixer fit nice and snug with padding in all the right places.  I can't really complain about the price either, it is definitely worth it."
1022,R1H72XSZWL7RAI,3,"Three Stars Bought 5, one of them doesnt work"
8608,R3FLYZ74UGLPGR,2,"Bent Within minutes, 2 of the notes stopped working. I opened it up and was just an issue with some of the reeds being bent. It's working, and considering the price it's still likely a good deal - but having to open it up to fix causes a low score."
5564,R3KCATI2ZOFB5E,5,"Great Machine Heads I have used Sperzel locking machine heads in the past and give them high marks for quality and stability.  When looking for machine heads for a new project, I found that Sperzel offered the heads in a chrome finish in addition to the satin finishes.  They were easy to install and I am very pleased with the product."
3459,R14FQ6QYJJSRVR,4,"Meet my expectations Meet my expectations, very good quality and sound, of course for a fun home karaoke. I don't give the fifth star because one of the 9v batteries (the regular square ones) after 6 hours of very intensive Karaoke singing runs out of power, nothing that you can not solve with a regular alkaline battery. I bought this one rather than other cheaper models, because of the mixed output, for me it was important because my equipment only has one input. Cheers!"
3469,R1E24TS4GI3GVI,5,Great Gift! Got this for my daughter Christmas of 2007.  It is awesome and she loves it.  Especially useful b/c she can recharge her ipod!  Would buy and recommend again!

7443,R2N4R4PZ87JF9Z,5,"I'm pretty sure Levy's Leather discontinued this strap I'm pretty sure Levy's Leather discontinued this strap, I wish they hadn't. It's my favorite strap. It was pretty hard to find the one I have. I had to get it used of Amazon."
1002,R24FAM65RTEO6C,5,Made a wonderful gift!!! I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my husband. He was beyond excited! He has now made dozens of picks and loves finding news things to punch from! Great product!
1835,R3IS0DZFWFXEMR,5,"$299?? This thing is absolutely incredible. I mean, truly. It's amazing. Everything you want and more. Tape crinkle? A knob to control how old your tape is that you're emulating? Versatile. Lots of praises to give this thing.<br /><br />But.... I do NOT know why it's listed as $484??? Buy it straight from the strymon site. It's only $299...."
2728,R2FRB46CA26QDO,5,I've owned much more expensive banjos I didn't like nearly as much as My Epi MB-100 I've owned much more expensive banjos I didn't like nearly as much as My Epi MB-100.  Definitely worth more than the selling price.
3463,R2BCXDVLHZ3CHY,2,Looked good! Never got to use it... Light bulb was broken on first and second attempt...<br />Maybe I should have thought twice before ordering something so fragile...
1992,R33T0HLR7TD27V,2,"I got what I paid for. This device doesn't work well with a 4-string bass plugged into it, as the \\""G\\"" setting doesn't recognize the open G string from my bass. It doesn't recognize the harmonic, either."

245,R9MLQY5SVY7L,3,"Great for listening to some classic Pink Floyd at work... Why did I buy this brand of headphones? Behringer is not exactly a household name, but I'd heard of them and owned a Behringer USB external sound card for a Mac mini - the quality vs. price on it was impressive, so I thought I'd give these a try. I got a bad one first (one channel was dead) and returned it to Amazon for a replacement which works fine.<br /><br />I'm using these headphones for casual listening of online content at work. They replaced some older Koss &#34;over the ear&#34; headphones which had developed a short. The Behringers were a little muddy for my taste, so I used the Realtek EQ on my PC to brighten them up a bit and I'm very pleased with the sound.<br /><br />Right now, I'm listening to a down sampled SACD of Dark Side of the Moon on YouTube (search for &#34;Pink Floyd Remastered Albums&#34; channel - even if you've heard this album 1000 times before, you'll hear something new here - makes me wish SACD/DVD audio had taken off... but I digress...). The only negative on the headphones is they are a little tight (just a little, not uncomfortable) but I haven't worn them in yet. They do block out the sound well so if you want a retreat from your &#34;cube mates&#34; in the office these headphones will help."
8385,R1O06H7CU5GZ59,4,"Gig Bag Accessory Think data entry.  You won't be playing pianistic material on this (what, with only two octaves?) and even keyboard parts don't work well.  It is clattery and sensitive and gives no firm feedback.  I can play a better riff on my old Casio SK-1.<br /><br />But for data entry?  It is portable.  It is cheap.  It is powered off the USB port, meaning all you need is a laptop and a pair of phones to work.  I have constructed some simple melodies with the thing, and it does work (that is, for recording parts into a sequencer for extensive editing.)  But where mine gets the most use is as a controller.<br /><br />I'm in the middle of yet another show where I have this keyboard stuck near the mixing desk with double-stick tape, spitting MIDI commands out to show control software running on a laptop.  For triggering both sequences and spot effects it is a great little tool.  And with it right there with me, I can edit a song I constructed in the home studio, even re-record a few riffs.<br /><br />I give this product four stars for what it is, not for what it could be.  Seriously -- you expect to find a decent keyboard for fifty bucks?  Especially one that can fit into a laptop bag?  With those constraints, this is actually flexible and fairly playable, if unsurprisingly fragile.<br /><br />Which is the greatest downside to this little keyboard; the keys break off with any excuse.  Even clattering around in a laptop bag it will come apart.  But then, when it does, you are only out fifty bucks."
6055,R3IG23C0ILRF2B,5,"Good enough for the Pros, good enough for anyone! Solid and reliable.  As a professional drummer I have toured nationally night after night with the Ludwig Atlas Pro! Couldn't ask for a better professional level pedal!"
8019,R14JF14EN56X93,3,Repetitive pattern Kids like it.  It does the same pattern over and over again.  Doesn't change.  I get a little vertigo if I stay in the room too long.
