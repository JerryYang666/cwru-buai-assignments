0,R2K6ELV08ZSTZA,B000TZVBDQ,5,Works great.,Needed this for my percussion class. Works great.
1,RC29WHMRFT68I,B000ULAP4U,5,Great headphones for anyone who loves or pursues music!,"Ive gone through my share of headphones, these are better than spending $300 or more on dr. dre beats, these have great quality highs-low-bass ect. very comfortable over the ears and it even has lil swivels that you can rotate to sit straight round your neck with the ear parts laying flat on your torso. Fast shipping as well and would recommend getting these!"
2,RLWXYOESSZQDF,B009MDMQJ4,5,"Much, Much better than I even hoped for","I recently purchased a very nice Fender Acoustic Guitar (her name is &#34;Suzanne&#34;  -- I name all my guitars).  I purchased this case because it looked nice and the price was very, very nice.  I have owned more than a couple of guitar cases and this is easily the nicest and most beautiful case I have ever owned.  I could not be more satisfied -- no, delighted with this case and this purchase.  You will feel the same about yours once you buy one.  The quality of construction and the solid way it is put together causes me to believe this case will hold up for many years of use."
3,RBSFRTPFZ3ZJF,B003WG2WXM,1,NOT WHAT I ORDERED,"These drum sticks were almost what they described but with one IIMPORTANT difference... THEY WERE NOT NYLON TIPPED. As a drummer that makes a HUGE difference when playing.<br />  You may well ask why I never returned them. The answer is that I actually would almost lose money to do so. I would only get back the price of the sticks - $16.00. I lose the shipping costs (approximately $11.00) PLUS the return shipping - about the same - and cost of fuel, materials, time and aggravation just to go to the post office to actually accomplish the return shipping. Add in the time it would take to get my money returned to my card and you can see why I decided to sell the sticks to a friend for half their value. I made back more money that way.<br />  I realize it's not Amazon's fault per se, but you might want to let your seller know they are NOT checking their products for comparability with their description of them. I also received notification, via USBS tracking, that it had been delivered when it wasn't and the package got here about a week later. All in all not worth the time and money!<br />Bruce Way"
