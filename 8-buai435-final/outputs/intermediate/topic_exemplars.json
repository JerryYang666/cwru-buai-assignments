      "Sounds only as good as the sound signal you feed into them I connected these to my internal sound card on my Dell XPS computer and I was not impressed at all.  I had to keep it down very low to keep the music from distorting.  If I turned the volume knob more that 25%, it sounded awful  I was not happy with these speakers one little bit.  I had heard much better sound coming from cheaper ~$25 amplified computer speakers before.  I then connected the speakers to my other computer that has a Behringer UCA202 USB sound card.  The speakers sounded nice and clean, but still not that loud.  The bass was fine if I was sitting 3 feet in front of the speakers, but get up and walk out of the room and all you would hear is mids and treble.  I tried mixing them with my 400 watt sub and was able to achieve a nice pleasant sound mix, but still the speakers definitely were not sounding worth the $150 dollars that I paid for them.  Matter of fact, I was thinking &#34;they couldn't possibly be putting out more than about 20 watts!&#34;  Then a friend loaned me their Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi Go! Pro USB sound card and WOW what a difference.  Now these speakers sound better than my 2 x 50 watt Kustom\/Powerwerks PA speakers.  I don't need to mix in the 400 watt sub either because these thing push out more than enough bass on their own.  Now I'm thinking, &#34;How can these things only be putting out 50 watts?&#34;  I have ordered 2 of those USB Sound Blasters and can't wait until Monday when they show up.  Update:  It's worth mentioning that the default crossover cutoff on the Sound Blaster was set to 80Hz using the default windows sound card driver.  Since I had the CR4 speakers I changed the cutoff to be 75Hz and it made a big difference.  Later, I downloaded and installed the latest Creative Labs sound driver from their website and it made the speakers sound even better!  So don't just accept the default driver that windows wants to install.  Update:  I have tried these speaker out in several different spaces and they sound there best inmy small 9' x 10' office, about 8 inches away from the wall.  They fill my office with big booming sound.  You would swear they were big home stereo speakers with a sub woofer attached,   As for larger spaces, they are not big enough to fill my 16' x 24' family room with sound, nor are they big enough for outdoor use.  The mids and treble sound so much better on these Mackies than any of my other speakers I have in the house regardless which space they are in.  They sound amazing for the small size.",
      "the real skinny These are great if you are not used to reference quality headphones.  When I got these I couldn't even conceive of there being better sounding headphones out there.  I thought I had the most amazing headphones on the planet.  They are rich and present, and fit comfortably.    My sales rep at Sweetwater talked me into investing in pair of Beyerdynamics DT 770 pros.  He recommended the 770Ms for my front of house mixing (They have better sound isolation than the DT770 Pros and are equivalent to the Sennheiser HD 280s for sound isolation) but I went with the DT 770Pro 250 ohm.    Check out the spec sheet on the HD 280s at [...]  You'll see that on these cans they don't show you the low end of their frequency response curve because in reality they drop off significantly under 80hz; they have a 5db variation throughout the rest of the sound spectrum.  The high lows around 100 hz are accentuated as well as the voices around 1K and the very highs around 10k.  Until you listen to headphones that have a really flat frequency response and are truly clear, like the DT770s you don't notice that the HD 280s lack clear low bass response and have really accentuated frequencies throughout the rest of the sound spectrum.  What you notice most when comparing side by side is the presence and clarity of the low bass in the DT 770s... which you never realized wasn't there in Sennheisers until you listened to the better cans.  The DTs are much clearer, much flatter.  After listening through the reference cans the HD 280s don't sound clear, and the gain in the 100 and 1K areas is really, really evident.    but we're not comparing apples with apples.  The DT770 Pros cost about 3 times as much.    Here is why you would buy the HD 280s:  They are amazingly versatile and a great DJ or front of house headphone.  Because of how they fold and articulate you can grab them by the right can, swivel it outwards and put it to your ear in one sweep... that means if you need to monitor a channel in your mix NOW you can with one hand in under a second.  They are great for this.  You don't need to use both hands and place them over your head to monitor with them.  I leave them plugged into my soundboard always when I am mixing live because they are so quick to grab and monitor with.    You would buy these if you are a drummer.  Our drummers love them.  They isolate very good and play loud. They are comfortable and stay put.  I never see our drummers fussing with them or adjusting them.  They put them on and play.  And these headphones are very, very, very durable and tough.  Our drummers are animals with equipment.  The cord on these has been stretched out for all it's worth, the headphones have been abused terribly and played extremely hard, a lot!  After a year or so the pads are still in excellent condition, the head band works like new and they play perfectly.  And they just keep going like the day we got them.    You would buy these if you only had limited funds and have never listened to studio grade headphones and don't plan to in the near future.  I was skeptical of a salesman trying to sell me an expensive set of cans when he recommended the Beyerdynamics.  This isn't to say the Beyerdynamics are better than Sennheisers, I haven't tried the high end Sennheisers to compare.  But, my salesman said very sincerely that the DT770s were worth the money.  They are.  I like the 250 ohm DT770 Pros a lot.  They are almost too clear to mix with... everything sounds good in them.  Using an optical link between my computer and stereo listening with the DT770s is an incredible experience.   If I was a drummer I would buy these and never need another pair of anything.  I would buy them if I was a DJ.  They isolate great and are plenty loud, and the things you need to hear stand out perfectly in a noisy environment.    For front of house monitoring I would definitely recommend them.  I've let other sound guys use these for mixing live and they are in love with these headphones!    But, being a sound engineer who records and edits music... even if I had unlimited funds to spend on a set of cans, though I would buy these first for their versatility, I couldn't own just them for their sound quality because of the fact that I master with my headphones.  I don't even listen to HD280s if the DT770s are within reach.  Truthfully, compared to the DT770s they sound terrible.  But compared to nothing... they do sound great.",
      "WONDERFUL noise isolation (main focus of this review) INTRO: As alluded to in the headline, my review is focused on the noise isolation abilities of these headphones. If you're looking for specific details about the sound quality, you'll probably want to skip my review (or just read the sections that interest you).<br \/><br \/>A LITTLE ABOUT SOUND QUALITY: I can't possibly add anything that hasn't already been mentioned dozens of times in these reviews, except to say that I agree with many that this is simply the best-sounding pair of headphones I've ever had the pleasure of using. Although they are marketed as \\\\\"monitor\\\\\" or \\\\\"reference\\\\\" headphones, I have to agree with some other reviewers that they actually have a bit of an emphasis on the low and high end rather than a flat response throughout the frequency spectrum. All in all, I think they sound pretty much perfect, and with their low impedance of 32 ohms, they perform wonderfully from any source without a dedicated headphone amp.<br \/><br \/>BACKGROUND\/WHY I WANTED THEM: I wanted these headphones because they fit the bill with respect to what I was looking for: circumaural (over the ear) closed headphones, and they were the most highly regarded pair under $300 that I could find. However, I wanted them most of all for noise cancelling, because I lived in an apartment complex with a bunch of really inconsiderate neighbors who kept their home and car stereos at 11 all the time--with the result that I was constantly having to listen to their bass rumbling through my walls and slowly being driven insane. One day I decided I couldn't take it anymore and went hunting for anything that would allow me to control my own sonic environment. I went and picked up several brands of earplugs from the local Walgreens (I wrote an exhaustive review of two brands of Hearos and Howard Leights here on Amazon) and immediately bought a pair of Klipsch S4 in-ear headphones. Both of these options worked well, but I was looking for something that would really transport me--so I went looking for the holy grail of silence: noise-cancelling headphones.<br \/><br \/>NOISE CANCELLATION vs NOISE ISOLATION: What I discovered later is that the only \\\\\"noise cancelling\\\\\" headphones take batteries (like Bose's flagship models) and generate frequencies that literally cancel out the sound waves from constant sources of noise, such as airplane engines. What it turned out I was looking for was \\\\\"noise isolation,\\\\\" which is created by having a good enough seal around your hears that outside noise can't get in. I actually purchased and tried another model of Audio Technica headphones that offered noise cancellation (ATH-ANC7B, available on Amazon), but they turned out to be a dealbreaker because of a tragic flaw: they \\\\\"leak\\\\\" sound to the outside world, so other people can hear what you're listening to. I later read that this is a necessary part of the architecture of noise cancelling headphones, so I returned them. (They also sounded a lot different--read \\\\\"worse\\\\\"--when the noise cancellation feature was not activated.)<br \/><br \/>NOISE ISOLATION OF THE ATH-M50: I got these shortly after returning the ATH-ANC7B, which is when I discovered that although the ATH-M50 don't cancel noise, they actually do a much better job isolating you from outside noise. They fit very well on my head and completely around my ears with no discomfort. With no music playing, outside sounds are muffled. I can faintly hear the tick of my (very loud) clock and the constant noise from my HVAC system, etc. I can also hear car loud car stereos going by outside. However, as soon as the music comes on, it's a different story--I can't hear a thing but what's playing in my ears! Because of this, I don't even need to turn up the headphones that loud, because none of it escapes; it all goes straight to my eardrums. Mind you, these things will go PLENTY loud, even when connected to my MP3 player (Zune 120, which I still love) or my smartphone (Galaxy S3). I can't imagine turning them all the way up with any source unless you want to go deaf within an hour. Although I live in a different and much quieter environment than when I began my quest for sonic control, I still need to escape and concentrate and turn to these headphones for solace. I have an arsenal of ambient noise MP3s and subscriptions to various YouTube channels that feature several-hour-long sounds of thunderstorms, windstorms, trains, etc. This combination packs a winning punch that never fails to put me in my own world for as long as I want. UPDATE: I had the chance to use these on a commercial flight and I was blown away by the ability of these cans to block out noise. With no music, outside sound is muffled pretty effectively; with music on, if you turn up the volume appreciably, ALL sound gets blocked out. If you don't care about listening to music and just want to drown out your environment (on a plane or elsewhere), I recommend downloading some ambient sound files (white noise, or my favorite--brown noise) and set it on repeat.<br \/><br \/>COMFORT: There seems to be a range of opinions in other reviews of the comfort of these headphones. Some people find them supremely comfy, while others complain of becoming fatigued after wearing them for varying lengths of time. I am in the former category, because I can wear these for hours with zero discomfort. The stock ear pads and headband are both very comfortable. However, after a long listening session (an hour or more), once I take them off I sometimes feel as though my ears need to \\\\\"pop,\\\\\" because everything sounds muddled. I generally don't turn the volume up too much, so I think it's a consequence of wearing closed circumaural cans for a prolonged period of time--your ears get used to a different level of air pressure. This sensation can last from a few seconds to a few minutes, but it always goes away after that.<br \/><br \/>MY ONLY BEEF (THE CABLE): I wish the cable was detachable, because I usually use these with my computer and only need 2-3 feet of cableto plug them into my front audio port. In retrospect, I should have gotten the coiled instead of the straight cable version. My solution was to loop most of the cable and secure it with two velcro straps, so only about 3 feet of cable is uncoiled. This works well, except for when I get up and suddenly almost rip the cable off of the plastic suction cup hook the coiled up portion rests upon. This is a minor quibble and shouldn't discourage anyone from buying these cans; the cable is pretty thick gauge and of high quality, so I don't worry at all about damaging it from my careless sudden movements.<br \/><br \/>ONE ADDITIONAL THOUGHT: I didn't want to spend the money on a dedicated headphone amp, so I bought an Asus Xonar DG sound card that head-fiers raved about on their forums (available quite cheaply on Amazon) and installed it in my computer. The card has an on-board amp that seems to work pretty well (it features three impedance settings for different types of headphones, which is neat), but the improvement in sound quality compared to my onboard sound was negligible. These cans are so dependable, even with somewhat questionable power sources, that you just don't need anything special to drive them. I do have one piece of advice, though: although it's convenient to plug these in to a headphone port on your computer speakers (if you have them), I noticed that you get much less bass. I think it's because the headphone port on typical computer speakers (I have Creative T12s, which are otherwise very competent at producing sound) is REALLY underpowered. Just a guess, but the sound is definitely way better from me front headphone port (which the Xonar DG now connects to in my system).<br \/><br \/>CONCLUSION AND A CAVEAT: If you are looking for an all-around great-sounding pair of headphones, you can't go wrong with these. If you're looking for a pair of headphones that will isolate you from the noisy outside world, they're great for that too. If you want a comfortable pair of headphones, I once again recommend these. Just beware that acquiring the ATH-M50 may unwittingly lead you down a path of looking for something even better, and you will spend many hours on audiophile forums looking for recommendations, and on Amazon checking prices for the cans they recommend. I haven't gotten any yet, probably because I have to spend close to $300 to get something better than these. For now, I'll stick with the ATH-M50 and keep feeling the peace of mind they've been giving me for the last several years!",
      "9 out of 10 Well, it took me a week of researching customer and tech reviews, but I finally settled on the Sennheiser EH 350s and I have been exceptionally happy with my choice.    The primary point of purchasing new headphones is because I play a bass guitar and I wanted a pair in order to hear the nuances of the music I am playing.  Also, I own a couple MP3 players and I wanted some headphones to use with them as well.    The first pair I bought, just willy-nilly really, was the Skullcandy Skullcrusher \\\\\"subwoofer\\\\\" headphones.  Big mistake, it was the worst $45 I ever spent.  Their mids and highs were lackluster, and the so-called \\\\\"bass\\\\\" was really just vibration with little really true bass frequency.  Sure I could \\\\\"feel\\\\\" the vibration of the bass, but it was impossible to pick out individual notes because it drowned everything out.  Then my dog chewed them up because he was disgusted as I was, and although I share his enthusiasm I was sad to see I couldn't return them :)    Anyway, the EH 350 is like night and day with the Skullcandy's.  The Sennheiser's really try to reproduce the original studio sound, hence why they are called monitor headphones, and they do an excellent job of it.  The sound is flat, as the sound is not artificially boosted, which also means that music that comes out of it will sound slightly quiet.  But I found that if I just jack up the volume on my preamp or mp3 player the sound comes out strong and loud.  I use a 30GB Zune, and it has plenty of power to blast out a sound that is just tolerable at highest volume.  This is good because some headphones out there have troubles producing a good volume with mobile devices.  Now onto the sound quality.    The mids and especially the highs are very well defined with these headphones.  They shine through with exceptional quality and precision, and although the highs are a bit stronger they actually balance well with each other.  The highs were a little too high upon first purchase, but after a couple days itmellowed out nicely without losing any of the previous power.  After only a two hour burn in, you will notice an appreciable improvement in sound quality.  I am excited to think how these will feel a month from now.     Of course, I really bought them for the bass.  Upon first purchase the bass was a little too quiet for me, or perhaps it might be better to say that the highs drowned it out too much.  Actually I think it was a mix of both, but now that a few days have passed the bass has become excellent.  Some reviews listed this product had a bass that was slightly too quiet.  The fact is, that is how bass usually sounds in the studio.  The key with bass is that you train your ear to hear it, rather then just try to buy headphones that artificially boost the bass.  If you want to hear a tight, true bass sound that has the power to blow your mind away, go out and buy a pair of $1000 dollar monitor speakers and feel the love.  Otherwise, you wont be able to beat the well balanced richness of the EH 350's bass.    The end effect?  Although the sound of monitor headphones can tend to be flat, the EH 350 sound comes out exceptionally well balanced.  Although I couldn't call them \\\\\"golden with richness\\\\\", they will however produce a sound that is so accurate to original studio that you will pick up hidden nuances and stylizations that you will have never heard before.  With these headphones, you can hear each of the individual instruments and voices of your favorite music instead of them all muddled together like other headphones who might sound more rich.  I would highly recommend these headphones to any musicians who are looking for monitor headphones on a budget but who don't want to sacrifice sound quality.  I also recommend these headphones to anyone who has ever wanted to play an instrument or sing, these headphones make it easy to tune your ear to individual instruments and puts forth and incredibly accurate note and pitch.    Note however that the EH 350s, like most monitor headphones, are open ear.  That means that sound is allowed to pass freely out of the headphones.  This allows the sound to extend past the headphones and makes it so that the shape of the headphone cup does not distort the sound like a lot of closed-ear headphones will do, and it has the additional benefit of keeping airflow within the cups, so your ears never sweat or become uncomfortable.  On the other hand, although the EH 350s are pretty good at keeping at least moderate noise levels out, other people around will be able to hear what you are listening, especially in quiet or small quarters.  These might not be the best headphones for you if you are wanting to take them on the bus or be in crowds.  Some headphones are large and noticeable.  I have noticed that the Sennheiser's are small and stylish enough to at least go largely unnoticed, but I wouldn't call them attractive.    But how do they fit?  It is true that Sennheiser's are slightly tight as many reviewers have stated.  But this is how they are designed.  I am a male with a reasonably sized head.  I wont say I have the biggest head out there, but I have been known to have a sizeable noggin.  Although the EH 350s sit tight, they do not sit uncomfortably so.  In fact, the tight fit is actually a necessity to the open ear system of the headphones and improves sound quality, and as I stated previously this makes them able to reasonably block out moderate external sounds without losing the benefit of open ear headphones.  They also are slightly too bulky to take jogging and undoubtably would be uncomfortable if you took them running with you.    One other point before I move on, the cups on these headphones are slightly small.  I would say I have slightly smaller then average sized ears for a man and they go around my ear and sit on my skull, but people with large ears might find the cushions lying on the ears instead of around them.  It is also very important to note that the leather cushion on the top of the headphones should rest firmly upon the top of your head as to hold some of the weight.  If you over adjust these headphones the weight will fall on the cups and your ears will begin to rest on the hard plastic within.  After about an hour, this will cause discomfort.  This is, of course, easily alleviated by simply properly adjusting them to fit your head.    What about value?  At prices well under $100 dollars, these headphones are easily worth twice their price.  I don't think any headphones at any price will be able to beat the 350s precision.  You will have to begin looking at the $200 dollar price range if you want headphones that will have the precision of the 350s and have a more full bodied richness.  I hear the 595s might be what your looking for if you have dough to spend.     Overall, the Sennheiser EH 350s get a five star, 9 out of 10.  With a perfect balance of precision and value, you can't beat these headphones if you have less then a hundred dollars to spend.    Oh, and thankfully, my dog has decided to spare these headphones... for now..."

      "Cordoba C10 CD\/IN Review This is my first all solid classical guitar and I must say I should of bought this guitar sooner. The response and tone of the guitar is immaculate when compared to any laminated or compress ply-wood guitar. By just playing the first bass string you'll hear the difference. I took a while checking out other guitars and what made me chose this guitar was the deep basses that came out and the crisp trebles, it made me wonder why the guitar was going at such a bargain? but never the less I swooped it up as soon as I played it. I paid USD999.99 for this bad boy and I got it with the HumiCase which now gives me lifetime warranty...oh yeah. I highly recommend the Cordoba C10 CD\/IN to any student looking for an all solid wood, great sounding classical guitar but can't afford to pay $2000+ for an instrument .  Trust me, you won't regret buying this guitar. For full specs on the guitar check the link below.<br \/><br \/>[...]",
      "Black on Black B-4 I bought this starter guitar I did my homework. I wanted to make a well informed decision rather than just buy what everybody else is buying. So when I came across this guitar I read up on it and after a taking my time and reading up on other guitars I ended going back to the 8\\\\\" inch Beginner Black on Black shinny guitar. Quality of the Paint job is as good if not better than that of a name brand's. Guitar was sprayed with its 1st coating of paint (flat Black ) followed by a coating of black paint that has a gloss to it, thus making the guitar shinier and re-enforcing it. Then last but not least finished off by applying a clear gloss enamel coating. This is done so the guitar can look nice and shinny, protection from the elements like water humidity etc. It also re-enforces your guitar making it a bit more stronger, all this while helping your guitar to sound better. Now on the flip side of the coin, it's become a ritual to have to tune my 6 stringer at least once if not more. Just depends on how much I practice. Now I live in Austin TX, were its humid. come summer its unreal!! So I'm not sure what seems to be the reason why all that tuning is required. Now my guitar came with a guitar bag which one of the fly zippers went bad within the 1st day. It came with a set of guitar strings, 2 guitar picks, and a Allen wrench if I'm not mistaken, and that was it. Oh!!! BTW first day I started tuning it, I snapped a chord ( G ) chord to be exact. Guitar is ok for beginners and or people on a fixed income. Once you get better then you can upgrade. No need for u to have to grow to fit the guitar. Get one that will make u grow and at the same time will grow at your speed. No need to pay lots of cash 4 something your not sure your gonna stick too!!! If you end up liking it then great, u will now have more knowledge of guitars that will come in hand and will be an advantage to you cause you'll know what you want. Now if it turns out that its not 4 you then at least it didn'tcost you a fortune, no harm no foul!",
      "Excellent guitar for the price. I have owned a Taylor 816 an an 614.  I loved both guitars and would love to have the 816 again. But at $3400 i'll wait. I also travel and don't want to spend $$$ for a guitar and have the airlines destroy the guitar.  I had this happen with an expensive Martin (:. Airlines don't cover guitar damage.  So I went to the store and tried out all the acoustic guitars. This was the guitar that came closest to the feel and sound of my 816.  And for $450 it was a deal.  I have played it for three weeks and have no regrets.  It has a quality build and sound.",
      "GREAT GUITAR I absolutely love this guitar. It is a really good guitar for its price. I am glad I bought it.  The guitar is of course not a full size so it is a little smaller, meaning the fingerboard is smaller in width and the strings are closer. Since I am of smaller size, it is perfect. Since classical guitar shouldn't really have position marker on the front of the fretboard, It has position marking on the superior side of the fretboard. It is a classical guitar so it has nylon strings instead of steel. Like most classical guitars, it doesn't sounds as sharp and crispy, instead it has a gentle and mellow sounds which I love. Much better than my old acoustic guitar.   It tends to go out of tune pretty quickly but since I have a software for tuning it is no problem. I think it sounds amazing once tuned. It is also very beautiful and glossy, the surface is smooth and,in my opinion, flawless. The design of the panda is great as well! Very unique!   Shipping was quick and painless. It arrives 2 days before the estimated arrival date.  Along with this guitar is a guitar case which the guitar fits in perfectly, maybe a little tight at first but you just have to make sure that the case is fully open up. After that it fits right in.   The DVD that came along with this guitar is great! Full of information for beginner. The instructions are clear and simple enough to understand to start learning how to play a guitar right away with various chords, patterns, techniques,and much more.  Overall this is a great price for a guitar, you can't find a better deal. I'm glad I bought it."

      "Good solid case I ordered one of these to fit an old Gibson LG-3. Another reviewer said his LG-3 fit this case, so I took the chance on it. Several other cases on Amazon do not post the internal dimensions, so I could not figure out what case would fit my old Gibson small-body. This case arrived quickly, and I was very impressed with it's quality. The case fit the intended guitar fantastically! The case also has a lockable latch, like 98% of all other cases. I am quite happy with mine.",

      "Gig bag that feels like a case I'm always a bit leery of gig bags, but they have their purpose. I took a chance on this because I have two basses, I do not gig them (I'm a drummer), and hard case options for my 6-string are rare or would take a month's salary.<br \/><br \/>I got this thing in my hands and wow, I am very impressed. As a drummer, I know cases pretty well - especially those that protect my precious ear\/hand-picked cymbals. This one measures up with the best of them.<br \/><br \/>The case (I keep calling it a case, even though it's a 'bag', it feels that tough!), is laid out very well. Two separate compartments for your basses, nice and soft, tuners don't have to be adjusted 'in-line' to fit in their positions in the case, just a very good fit. The pockets on the front are very nice as well. The top on fits my 3\\\\\" leather strap very well. The bottom (large) pocket looks like the organizer pocket in a high-end laptop case. Then there's the furthest out pocket with see-thru mesh, to hold some stuff you need to get to quickly (picks, tuner, etc).<br \/><br \/>Inside I'm holding a vintage Aria Pro SB100 (Cliff Burton style), an Alvarez 6-string electric bass, strap, tons of picks, tuner, cleaning kit, pen, notebook, and some cables (6' and 25'). No bulging from the pockets!<br \/><br \/>I'm very impressed with this case (I mean bag). Definately a good buy to protect your basses. I really cannot recommend it enough. Will protect better than all but your top of the line cases anyway. Save yourself a fortune and protect your investments...heck, you can even carry two basses at once (although it does get very heavy)."

      "If you're not going for a bright tone, they're great. A lot of the critical reviews of these strings criticize the strings for sounding &#34;dull&#34; (which is really just another word for &#34;dark&#34;). If you want a really bright tone, then maybe these aren't the strings for you. But the brilliance\/brightness of a string's tone isn't an objective quality that determines how good the string is. It's a subjective one that determines how good the string is AT BEING BRIGHT.<br \/><br \/>Not every guitarist wants a bright tone. If you do, these probably aren't the strings for you. They do run a good bit on the dark side. But if you're playing heavier music, or you have a guitar that naturally sounds bright like I do, or your main priority is playing a comfortable string that won't break or rust after a month of playing, then I heartily recommend them. And if you want them to be bright, you could just go for the 9-42 gauge. I've tried both, and the 9-42s are definitely brighter than the 10-46s.<br \/><br \/>These strings will last you longer than certain, more famous, more expensive coated strings. Even the E and B strings, which are normally &#34;plain&#34; strings in most sets and usually go untreated, are coated and last a lot longer than the same strings in other coated sets. I could take or leave the black color, really, but I love the way these strings feel and last.",

      "fantastic strings In these strings I found my new favorites. I have had these string (all medium\/mittel) for more than 6 month and they are marvelous on my violin $3k chinese violin.<br \/><br \/>The good:<br \/>They are very responsive, quite powerful. The sound is complex with a nice golden shimmering ring to it.<br \/>Like other Pirastro strings these have a nice smooth wounding that lasts and is pleasant to play.<br \/>The G and D strings last a long time. With moderate every day playing I am still waiting to see one failing on me after 6 months.<br \/><br \/>The bad:<br \/>They are expensive. They are more tense if you are used to e.g. Dominats or even gut strings.<br \/><br \/>The E string:<br \/>The E string is powerful and RICH with a golden ring to it. I tried many E string, this one has an unmatched rich\/full sound to it. If you prefer a cleaner\/focused sound try Jagar E, Pirastro Gold E, or Prim E, or  or or. The Lenzner Goldbrokat E is somewhere in between. Of course, your violin might react differently than mine.<br \/>This Piratro Gold E string is much more fragile than many other E strings I played before. The coating is lasting, but the string breaks at the fine tuner easily. I always have to lower the tension before traveling. Needless to say I forget it sometimes. For me, the sound makes more than up for it. I absolutely love it.<br \/><br \/>The A string:<br \/>The A string is very dominant. It easily cuts through a piano or even orchestra - Good for solo playing, but for my taste too harsh. It is also not as long lasting. For now I substituted with a cheap Tonica A string. There might be a better substitute -> experiment yourself and let me know.<br \/><br \/>The G string:<br \/>Like the E string the silver G string is also fantastic. Unlike many other G strings this one does not have a very low tonal color. It sounds alive! I only tried the silver G, and not the gold G string. Sorry, I refuse to pay $50 for just a G string.",

      "Unstable when stacked per manufacturer instructions Overall I like K&M microphone stands. I own several tripod base stands with booms and I own two of these one handed stands.<br \/><br \/>Stacking... The instruction sheet included with the stand is in German, which I don't read. But there are illustrations that I can follow. The manufacturer recommends that you stack the stands by aligning the post from the top stand over a round hole on the lower stand. The problem is that the hole is too small for the top stand to fit all the way through. The result is that the top stand floats and wobbles around the small hole and the base of the top stand doesn't make full contact with the bottom stand. It's difficult to describe in words but the bottom line is that it's not stable in this configuration. What does work is if you align the pole of the top stand over the larger cutout area of the bottom stand. This configuration will allow the base of the top stand to make full contact with the bottom stand and be stable.<br \/><br \/>Size of microphone tread... The product description doesn't specifically state it, but in case you're wondering, the microphone thread size is 5\/8 inch, which is standard in the US for most microphone stands. It is not 3\/8 inch, which is common on Europe.<br \/><br \/>Shaft locking mechanism... The one-handed grip allows you to easily adjust the height of the stand with one hand, but it comes with a trade off. The result is that it doesn't lock as tightly as a tradition twist lock stand. With moderate force you can push the shaft down without pressing the release lever. This behavior is more noticeable when you have a heavier microphone mounted on the stand and push down on it lightly. The shaft may move easily while in the locked position.<br \/><br \/>Overall it's not a perfect design but it is very convenient to adjust the height of the stand. This stand is also less costly than some other one-handed stands.",
      "Works quite well for a mic stand All things considered, this item is performing well. I don't move it around or change the angle very often, so I can't really speak to its ability to stand up to change. Everything tightens up quite easily and stays in place even after the mic is attached. One thing you will want to make sure of is that the mic is over the third leg of the mic stand to prevent it from tipping over.",
      "Not for standard mic stands. It is only 31&#34; long, my smallest mic stand is around 38&#34;.  It will not hold a standard microphone stand, not even broken down. I'm sending it back.",
      "MIC STAND TO CAM STAND MIC STAND TO CAM STAND, my mic stand sits in the corner and collects dust now i can use it for a camera stand and even a light stand,I made a custom light mount to work with this little adapter"
