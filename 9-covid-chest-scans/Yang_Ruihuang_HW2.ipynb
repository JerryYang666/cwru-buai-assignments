In this context, automatic and accurate detection of COVID-19 using medical imaging modalities, such as Computed Tomography (CT), can be beneficial as a diagnostic tool.\n",

        "In this exercise, our goal is to develop Convolutional Neural Networks to automatically detect the subtle signs of COVID-19 infection in patients' lungs from CT images. Our dataset contains 1010 CT scans from individuals with COVID-19 and 1010 CT scans from patients with other pulmonary diseases (non-COVID-19). These data have been collected from real patients in hospitals from Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n",

Given the small size of the original dataset, I did not set aside any images for the test set. We will use the validation accuracy to evaluate our models. This is OK since we are not going to use the validation performance as a feedback signal to fine tune the hyperparameters of our models.\n",
