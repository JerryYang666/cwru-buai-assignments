    "As the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to challenge many countries around the world, testing to detect COVID-19 and isolating individuals who test positive remains a crucial strategy for preventing community spread of the disease. In this context, automatic and accurate detection of COVID-19 using medical imaging modalities, such as Computed Tomography (CT), can be beneficial as a diagnostic tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, our goal is to develop Convolutional Neural Networks to automatically detect the subtle signs of COVID-19 infection in patients' lungs from CT images. Our dataset contains 1010 CT scans from individuals with COVID-19 and 1010 CT scans from patients with other pulmonary diseases (non-COVID-19). These data have been collected from real patients in hospitals from Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our training and validation sets include 1600 and 420 CT images, respectively (half COVID-19, half non-COVID-19). Given the small size of the original dataset, I did not set aside any images for the test set. We will use the validation accuracy to evaluate our models. This is OK since we are not going to use the validation performance as a feedback signal to fine tune the hyperparameters of our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to classify the images correctly by building multiple CNNs and comparing their performance.\n",

    "Training accuracy rose from 88.5% to 99.5% over 50 epochs while the validation curve peaked around 99.1% at epoch 21–26 and slowly drifted between 98–99%. Losses tell the same story—training loss keeps dropping (0.33 → 0.018) whereas validation loss bottoms out near 0.031 and then oscillates upward (e.g., 0.039 by epoch 44, 0.036 at epoch 50).  \n",
    "This widening generalization gap after ~20 epochs indicates classic overfitting: the model continues to memorize the training set even though validation performance no longer improves appreciably. Because we use no augmentation or strong regularization, the simple CNN saturates quickly, so Question 2 needs data augmentation / transfer learning to improve robustness rather than chasing more epochs here."
